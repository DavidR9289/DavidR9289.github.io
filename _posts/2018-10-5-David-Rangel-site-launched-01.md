In class we made national flags and we learned about websites that help us learn about the flags and taught us about it and we had to make it on paper with paper but I didnt finish :(. We also worked on the definitions of certain codes such as < p > and etc. I was strugggling with the codes because at first I did not know the definitons but soon I learned on how to understand them.
