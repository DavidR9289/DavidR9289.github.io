What we learned about this week is things related to functions and examples of them and also definitions. The 13th of November we came back my class and I were introduced to a the board asking how to define our names, eye color and age. For example if I wanted to put my name and define it I would have to put (define my-name("David") and the computer would define it. Same thing would have gone with my eye color and my age. The same lesson we learned what not to do when doing defining our name, age, and eye color. We also went back to revise what a string is. Yesterday the 15th we talked about a rocket blasitng off and what you would like to know such as the type of rocket, where its going, and where is it's starting point and at the end we catergorized the each others ideas.
