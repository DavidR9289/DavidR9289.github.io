What I learned this week that impressed me and helped me understand more about coding was String -> Image. It is basically a contract that has certain parts like the name, domain, and range. For example (big-star "purple") is a string -> to an image. We got worksheets and it they were basically about connecting the functions to the contracts for it can make sense. There is also more then that, there's string number-> image and it can keep going as long as the contracts match the functions.
