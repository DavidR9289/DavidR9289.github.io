This week my classmates and I have been working on our flags that we were assigned given by where we sit for example if you sat in the side you would of been given a letter from A,B,C,D,E,F and I was given F which was the United Kingdom if I wanted the highest garde you can get and that made it the most challenging. We were told to do a "outline" of our chosen flag on Construction paper but thats when everybody started to struggle in. I started struggling when we began to create the flag and that was the challenge. The United Kingdom flag had diagonal lines and a  background of white that was outside of the red stripes so I was mainly struggling with that.
