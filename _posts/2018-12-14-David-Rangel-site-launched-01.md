So far this week we have been working on our flag project and I ended up getting the United Kingdom and so far i've been making a good amount of process, I have been struggling with the diagonal lines of the flag but I have learned how to rotate them so I have been playing around with that. Another challenge I have been facing in this week is getting the right size and the right colors on the flag but I've decided that i'm going to do that when I am completely done with the flag. A goal coming up for the flag is obviously finishing it by next week and doing the best I can to make it as accurate.
